With their network and expert knowledge of the area, we trusted their judgement and were delighted by the cycling routes (great mixture of terrain and scenery); the hikes arriving at Glow Lake was one of the most special moments, we have never found somewhere so remote, wild and beautiful before or since.

We did the Eastern Arunachal Pradesh Multi Activity Tour in one week (four days cycling, two days hiking) and were guided by Iho, one of the NbNE guides, who was an extremely supportive, attentive, and capable leader. We are relatively experienced travellers, used to go on our own, and were hesitant at first to follow an organised trip. But we realised that we would hardly have been able to get to the places we visited, let alone to cycle there (considering also the hassle with logistics). Parts of the tour were off motorable roads, crossing a river without a bridge and small villages in areas where it is hard to stock up on food, and we hiked through thick jungle where you have to go with a guide anyways. Accomodation was basic but having someone preparing delicious food for us even in the jungle was a great luxury that we enjoyed a lot. Don\u2019t expect much more luxury, though. It\u2019s all simple, but real. The places in Arunachal Pradesh are definitely off the beaten track. This makes encounters with local tribes people all the more authentic.

These tribes provide a cultural bridge between India and south East Asia, China, Inner Asia and Burma by ethnic and linguistic angles, as most of these tribes migrated here from the North and the East over the centuries.These eight states in themselves constitute a single linguistic region with about 220 languages in three different language groups (Indo-Aryan, Sino-Tibetan and Austric).The earliest recorded history can be traced back only to the Ahom kings (16thAD) who ruled the Brahmaputra valley.

It has been pooled under the Eastern Himalayan and the Indo-Burmese Biodiversity hot spots. The close proximity of the High Himalayas to the coast has created a compact stretch of land with a multitude of vegetation. If we take a closer look, we see that the Ecology of the region varies from Alpine Tundra in the northern regions to Tropical and Sub tropica Rainforests in the lower areas. The central river valleys support Grasslands and large wetland areas. This variety in Eco-systems has created a heaven for bio-diversity. This region also boasts of the highest density of protected Wildlife Reserves in the country. Kaziranga, Manas, Nameri and Namdapha National Parks are some of the better known ones.
