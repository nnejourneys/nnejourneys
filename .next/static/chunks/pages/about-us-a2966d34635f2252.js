It took us some time to get a clear vision of our intentions here and how to go about it. The argument was between authenticity vs catering to popular demands that usual tours offer. Our intention is to provide active, interactive and authentic tours to the truest form. We have no intention of changing the local way of life in any degree to cater tourist demands, rather we work to facilitate authentic observation, interactions and experiences. The sensitive nature of this region\u2019s people and environment requires that our actions are not detrimental in the long run, for change happens slowely yet surely. Over the past decade we have worked hard to ensure our itineraries are unique and beyond the superficial. We have no intention of aping any trends, rather be driven by local specialities, practicalities and most importantly by our conscience.","ae":"/images/philosophy.jpg","qd":"Our Vision for our Region","sp":"To give authentic local prospective to our guests. Facilitate safe, enjoyable and responsible travel. All local personnel and logistic support. Small locally owned and managed establishments be it Homestays, Lodges, Community guest houses etc. Facilitate authentic interactions and experiences. Train and empower local youth to be able to take up tourism related activities to showcase this abundant region in a safe and sustainable manner.","C_":"/images/ceo.jpg","kT":[{"icon":"fluent:people-community-24-regular","title":"Local Team"},{"icon":"fluent:vehicle-car-24-regular","title":"Locally owned Transport"},{"icon":"fluent:building-shop-24-regular","title":"Purchases from small locally owned businesses"},{"icon":"fluent:home-24-regular","title":"Local Family & Community owned Accommodation"}],"Dv":"  Right from the onset our intent has been to make a difference, to be meaningful and most of all sustainable in the long run. We had a lot of experience in the operational side of running tours, however our mind was far outweighed by questions of how to go about things beyond the operations. The main questions were to do with how we could be more impactful locally, how our activities did not change the overall local way of life and how could our tours be more authentic and bring out the local prospective. Over the years we have evolved, mostly through trial and error. We started with forming a all local team of willing individuals who were not tainted by the usual understanding of &lsquo;Tourism&rsquo; and yet very handy in their surroundings. We have tried our best to generate income for locals in a way that though fairly substantial is not their primary source of imcome, a way that encourages them to continue their usual way of life. We dont encourage locals to dress up, dance etc for tourist, for these things are best observed in its true authenticity during festivals. We never bargain with the bottom of the chain, the people who make all this a reality, we firmly belive in dignity and equality of labour.
