 We take you to far east of India, to the land of the ‘Dawn lit ‘Mountains’. Typically when one talks of Arunachal Pradesh, Tawang and Ziro valley automatically come up, rest remains mostly unknown. Here we take you all the way to far eastern Arunachal Pradesh bordering China and Myanmar, in fact, to the point where the first rays of the sun hits India.
On this tour you will explore the easternmost part of India, meet the Animist and Buddhist tribes who reside here, soak in the unparalleled vistas, hike in the worlds northernmost rainforest, visit the Therevada Buddhist temples, sample local cuisine and much more.

The entire proceedings has been designed with the  intention to take you far from the hustle bustle of daily life and deep into inarguably the wildest region of India.
