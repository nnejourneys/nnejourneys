We take you to one of the least known part of Northeast India. The eastern bit of the region buffering Tibet and Myanmar lies in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. This is a region of giant rivers, unending forests and a ring of hills climbing ever higher till it becomes snowy peaks at the Chinese border. This region is home to the Theravada Buddhist tribes who live in the plains and the Animist ones who live in the hills.
