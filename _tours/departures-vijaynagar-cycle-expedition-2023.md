Everybody talks about it, yet only a handful have ever reached Vijaynagar ( till a year back it used to take about 6-7 days walk to get there...then you walked it back). This is the last of exploratory expeditions of the Indian subcontinent.

Vijaynagar, the last village of India and one of the most remote administrative circles of the country is situated in the eastern end of Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh. This little hamlet  lies 160 Km across the Namdapha National Park, which is the worlds northernmost tropical rainforest. Till just a year back one had to walk about 7 days to get to Vijaynagar. The local name for the place is Daudi. It has a population comprised of the Lisu (known as Yobin in China) community and the Assam Rifles Ex-Servicemen from primarily the Gorkha community.
This particular expedition starts from Tengapani located in the Lohit valley, which is home to the Khamti tribe. Just the first day of cycling takes you acoss territories of 3 distinct tribes. The next 4 days are spent cycling through the rainforest of the Namdapha National Park. For this duration you will be totally cut off from civilization, with no phone signal till you arrive back in Miao. Enroute, you will camp in some of the most secluded and beautiful spots that one can imagine.
